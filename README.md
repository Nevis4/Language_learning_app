## Getting Started

For the program to work, we first need import sys and from PySide2 import QtCore, QtWidgets, QtGui

```python
      import sys

      from PySide2 import QtCore, QtWidgets, QtGui
   ```
You can also enter any words you want in fn main()
 
 ```python
     def main():
      dictionary = {
        'dog': 'pies',
        'cat': 'kot',
        'hello': 'witaj',
    }
   ```
       

## Usage

The program opens an application window with words that need to be translated on the left side.
On the right side we have inputs for entering the translated words.
After translating all of them, we can click the "check" button and we get our result.
